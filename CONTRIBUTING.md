## Bug Reports

Something wrong? If you find that something is not working properly, please [submit a bug report][new issue]. In the bug report, please include all relevant and detailed information such as version, operating system, error messages, and steps to reproduce the bug. The more information, the better!

## Feature Requests

Have an awesome idea for a new feature and want it added? Please [submit a feature request][new issue]. It is always great to hear new ideas on how the project can be improved.

You are welcome to [fork][fork] the project, implement the feature yourself, and [submit a pull request](#pull-requests). The *preferred method* would to [open an issue][new issue] describing the feature to open a discussion before implementing the feature.

## Pull Requests

If you would like to contribute by a new enhancement or feature, please [fork][fork] the project and once you are done, please [submit a pull request][pulls] with the feature.

## General Notes

Please keep [bug reports](#bug-reports), [feature requests](#feature-requests), and [pull requests](#pull-requests) as detailed and specific as possible. I'd *prefer* to have lots of small tasks *instead of* a small list of large tasks. Thanks!

## Style guide

- Variables and functions should follow `lower_case` naming convention. The *only* exception is for constants, which should use `UPPER_CASE`.

- *Prefer* local variables instead of global variables.
